# lambda-calculus

This is an interpreter for the lambda calculus, the goal is to build it up following the outline presented at https://www3.nd.edu/~dchiang/teaching/pl/2022/index.html by Dr. David Chiang. It originally started as an SML interpreter for the NB language, which will follow an evolutionary process as it is converted into an Untyped Lambda Calculus Interpreter, then into a Typed Lambda Calculus Interpreter and finally a Dependently Typed Lambda Calclulus Interpreter.

I have also found these notes to be quite helpful in understanding the idea and implementation of dependent types in the Lambda Calculus: https://www.andres-loeh.de/LambdaPi/
